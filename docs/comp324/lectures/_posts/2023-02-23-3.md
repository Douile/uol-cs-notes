## Degree Distribution
Let $f_d$ denote the fraction of vertices of degree $d$ in a given network (where the total number of vertices are $n\times f_d$).

Degree Distribution
: The sequence of $(f_0, f_1, \ldots f_{n-1})$ of a given network.

	This is an array of values, not a scalar.

Therefore, given a network with $n=20$, $f_{12}$ means that there is one vertex with degree 12:

$$
n\times f_{12}=20\times0.05=1
$$

## Power Laws
![Power law degree distribution function of the Internet graph.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Nehez/publication/280577324/figure/fig1/AS:284644382658571@1444875917645/Power-law-degree-distribution-function-of-the-Internet-graph.png)

We *may believe* that there is a linear relationship between the log of $f_d$ and the value of $d$ for a given network:

$$
\log f_d=-\alpha\times\log d+c
$$

this implies:

$$
10^{\log f_d}=10^{-\alpha\times\log d}\times 10^c
$$

and therefore:

$$
f_d=\frac{10^c}{d^\alpha}
$$

Mathematical laws stating that a function $f(x0$ is proportional to $x^{-\alpha}$ (for some positive constant $\alpha$) are called **power laws**.

### Model Fitting
We should be careful when noticing linear trends in data we should say:

> The data we have fits (with a certain confidence) a power law.

### Power Law Detection
We may want to check if a set of data fits a power-law distribution.

#### Power Law Detection General Method

1. Find the degree distribution.
1. Plot the points $(\log d+1, \log f_d)$ having $f_d\neq 0$.
1. Use statistical methods to asses the statement: "the data at hand shows a degree distribution that obeys a power-law".

#### Power Law Detection with Linear Regression
In general data is given as array of values $X$ and $Y$:

* This is usually points $(X_i, Y_i)$ which equals $(\log(i+1),f_i)$ for all $i$ where the given network has at least one vertex of degree $i$.

Find the line of best fit in the form:

$$
y = c_1x+c_0
$$

using:

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_1&=\frac{\sum X_iY_i-(\sum X_i\sum Y_i)/N}{\sum X_i^2-(\sum X_i)^2/N}\\
c_0&=\frac1N\left(\sum Y_i-c_1\sum X_i\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

This line minimises error which is calculated by:

$$
E=\sum(Y_i-y_i)^2
$$
