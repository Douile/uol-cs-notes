## Sparse Random Networks
The binomial model can be tweaked to generate sparse networks $\mathcal G_{n,\frac cn}$:

* By changing the linking probability we bias the seelction process.
* In $\mathcal G_{n,p}$ the probability of picking a network with $m$ lines is:
	
	$$
	{N\choose m}p^m(1-p)^{N-m}
	$$
	
	where $N={n\choose2}$.
	
	When $p$ is small, this expression gives a higher change to graph with few links.

## Random Networks with Arbitrary Degrees
Take the following method:

1. Assign each node the desired number of **degree stubs**.
1. For each node's stub, assign an arc to another node's stub using a random number.
