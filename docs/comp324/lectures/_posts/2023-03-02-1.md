## Acquaintances
It is possible to derive acquaintances by analysis of the relation between people and events.

If two people attend the same event it is likely that they know each-other.

We can use this information to create a new graph where individuals have connections when they attend a shared event.

## Small Words
It is claimed that society can be described by a network characterised by small shortest path lengths.

We can conduct an experiment where we send a message. Each person involved must:

* Direct the message to the target if they know them personally.
* Direct the message to a friend they perceive to be closer to the target.

From experiments like this we know society is highly connected (with average $k=5.5$), however, social searching is slow, expensive and prone to failure.

To avoid failure:

* Motivation matters more than the access of an individual.
* Ease of access is also very important as the motivation required is reduced.

## Geweke Diagnostic
The Deweke diagnostic can quantify how representative of a graph a random walk is:

$$
z=\frac{\bar X_a-\bar X_b}{\sqrt{\text{Var}X_a+\text{Var}X_b}}
$$

where:

* $X_a$ is the first 10% of samples.
* $X_b$ is the last 50% of samples.

An ideal random walk would have the difference of averages be 0 (hence $z=0$) and variance of 1.
