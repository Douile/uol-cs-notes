Issues that encryption aims to solve:

* Incorrect relaying of information.
	* This has partial solutions.
* Eavesdropping on information.
	* This has many solutions.
	
## Solutions to Eavesdropping

* Control your environment such that there is no possibility of eavesdropping.
* Use a different language.
* Speak in code (using different keywords to create plausible deniability).

## Solutions for Written Text

* Sealing the message using a seal (not suitable for electronic communications).
* Prevent messages being read by non-recipients:
	* Hide the message.

### Steganography
This is the hiding of messages in non-secret messages.

* Hide information in the least significant bits of an image or audio file.

### Obscurity
Hiding the message is just security through obscurity:

* This is not suitable for e-commerce.


## Cryptography
Historical encryption schemes usually fall into two categories:

* Transposition - change the order and location of symbols.
	
	This technique is not used in modern methods as it often has significant redundant data and involves moving the letters physically.

* Substitution - replace symbols by other symbols.


### Transposition
#### Scytale

1. Make two sticks with the same diameter:
	* One for sender, one for receiver.
1. To encrypt - wrap the strip of paper around the stick and write on surfaces next to each other:
	* Fill other surfaces with random letters or place multiple messages at different starting points.
1. To decrypt - wrap the strip of paper around the stick and read the surfaces next to each-other.

#### Grille
Similar to Scytale:

1. Cut pieces out of paper, making two copies:
	* One for sender and receiver.
1. Encrypt by placing the paper with holes on top of the empty paper and write on exposed surfaces.
	* Continue on open spaces or fill with random letters.
1. Decrypt by placing the holes on top of the message and reading the correct letters.

### Substitution
#### Caesar Cipher
1. Replace every letter by the same letter shifted by $n$.

This has the following **weaknesses**:

* Brute-force as there are only 26 encryption keys.
* Known plain-text attack if you know one plain-text, cipher-text, pair then you can find the key.
* Chosen plain-text attack if you can trick the key-holder to encrypt plain-text of your choosing.
* Cipher-text only attack by using frequency analysis.

##### Information Leakage
Even if you can't decrypt it you can still see the following:

* Length of the message:
	* Can be avoided if you use padding.
	* You will always know an upper-bound message of the length even with padding.
* Similar plain-text gives similar cipher-text.
