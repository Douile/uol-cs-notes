## Right to Privacy

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. - Art.12 UDHR

There are several reasons to want privacy:

* Direct Harm
	* Harm to physical goods, possessions and reputation.
* Indirect Harm
	* Harm that would stop you from doing something you would otherwise.
* Someone watching your every move is not a nice feeling.

## Privacy Considerations

Sensitivity
: All information deserves some protection, but sensitive information deserves more.
	
	A bag search at a nightclub is reasonable but a cavity search is not.
	{:.info}
Target Individual
: Children and vulnerable people have increase privacy rights. Public people (politicians and celebrities) have reduced rights.
	
	Children have greatly reduced privacy rights with their parents.
	{:.info}
Extent of Disclosure
: Privacy is harmed more by public disclosure than by one person getting a glimpse.

Justification
: Better reasons allow greater invasion of privacy. **Consent** removes the limitations they allow.

Check the official guide to data protection at [https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

* In the UK and EU, privacy regulation is called the **general data protection regulation**.
* GDPR is complemented in the UK by the **data protection act** 2018 (DPA)
	
	This provides specific legislations required by the GDPR.
	{:.info}
	
* The **information commissioner's office** (ICO) enforces the GDPR and DPA.

There is also the ePrivacy Regulation in the EU that regulates cookies and mailing lists.

### Personal Data
The GDPR applies to any person or organisation that **processes personal data**.

Personal Data
: Information relating to an identifiable living individual.

Identifiable
: Enough to distinguish one person from another.

Only **full anonymisation** can make something not personal data.
{:.warning}

Information is still personal if it can be combined with public domain information to identify a person.
{:.warning}

**Processing data** means doing any of the following:

* Viewing
* Storing
* Modifying/Combining
* **Deleting**
* Publishing

**Controlling data** means deciding how and to what purpose it will be processed. This is where the main responsibility lies, they must pay the **data protection fee** to the ICO.

### Principles
The GDPR is organised around seven principles:

1. Lawfulness, Fairness & Transparency
1. Purpose Limitation
1. Data Minimisation
1. Accuracy
1. Storage Limitation
1. Integrity & Confidentiality (Security)
1. Accountability.
