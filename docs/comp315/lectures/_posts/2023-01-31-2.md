## Strategy, Operations & Tactics

These are in the following hierarchy:

* Strategy
	* Operations
		* Tactics

They apply to the following analogy:

```mermaid

Strategy <--> bm[Business Model]
Operations <--> td[Technology Decisions]
Tactics <--> Programming
```

This is to say that technology and programming both serve the business model.

## Build, Buy or Rent
When deciding whether to make any technology for e-commerce consider the following flowchart:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
subgraph Should I design my own e-commerce software?
hb[How big is your company] -->|huge| yc[Your choice]
hb -->|large| uf[Do you need usual features]
uf -->|yes| ue[Try to use existing solutions as far<br>as possible, but modify as needed.]
uf -->|no| tm
hb -->|small| tm[No. At most, make some tiny<br>modifications to an existing solution.]
end
```

Designing your own e-commerce is generally a bad idea.

### Available Options for Buy & Rent

* You could sell on an existing platform, like Amazon.
	* Reliable and convenient, but the platform will take a fee.
* You could purchase or rent a licence to an existing package. 
	* More flexible than using an existing platform, but can be costly.
* You could use (and possibly adapt) an open source platform.
	* Great flexibility, but requires more work and expertise than other options.
