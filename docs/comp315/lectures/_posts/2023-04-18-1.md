> A software **agent** that assists a user.

## User's, Services and Interfaces

* Bots act as an **interface**, connecting a **user** to a **service**.
* A **service** is anything you want to access.
* **User** might be human but could be some other software.

## Bots for E-Commerce
We will generally have to make the following decisions concerning bots:

* For customer assistance?
* For employee/company assistance?
* Can third party bots use the service?

### Customer Support

We may see the following different types:

* Dumb bots/similar to human support.
* Information only/can take actions.

When making a customer support bot we should keep the following in mind:

* High authority requires high **reliability**.
* Licensing existing bots works well for **complex bots**.
* Scripts/flowcharts for human support can often be used as a basis for a bot, especially when **less sophisticated**.

You should weigh whether the bot is really better than a FAQ or human customer support. If so you should still provide it alongside the alternatives.
