## One-time Pads
This method of encryption provides perfect secrecy provided that the following are met:

* The key should never be reused.
* The key needs to be at least as long as the message:
	* If a longer key is used then the message should be padded.
* You have a perfect source of randomness to generate the keys.
	
Encryption and decription is completed by:

* XORing the key with the message.

It is ideal in a scenario where you have:

* A slow secure channel to transfer keys in advance.
* A fast insecure channel where you can send your encrypted messages.

This method is too inconvenient to use in e-commerce.

## Public Key Encryption (RSA)
RSA relies on the following functions:

* Public key generation function `keygen`: $K \rightarrow L$
* Encryption function `enc`: $X\times L\rightarrow Y$
* Decryption function `dec`: $Y\times K\rightarrow X$

It also requires that the following are true:

* **Correctness** - `dec(end(x, keygen(k)), k)=x` for every $x\in X$ and $k\in K$.
* **Efficiency** - Given $k$ and $x$, it is feasible to compute `keygen(k)`, `enc(x, keygen(k))` and `dec(enc(x, keygen(k)), k)`.
* **Key Secrecy** - Given `l = keygen(k)` and multiple encoded messages using that public key, it is not feasible to compute any of the messages.

## Groups
In algebra a group is a pair $(G, \cdot)$ where $G$ is a set and $\cdot:G\times G\rightarrow G$ is an operator with the following properties:

Identity
: There is an identity element $\mathbf 1\in G$ such that $\mathbf1\cdot x=x\cdot\mathbf1=x$ for every $x\in G$.

Inverse
: For every $x\in G$ there is a $x^{-1}\in G$ such that $x\cdot x:^{-1}=x^{-1}\cdot x=\mathbf 1$.

Associative
: $(x\cdot y)\cdot z=x\cdot(y\cdot z)$ for every $x,y,z\in G$.

Additionally, a group is **finite** if the set $G$ is finite.
