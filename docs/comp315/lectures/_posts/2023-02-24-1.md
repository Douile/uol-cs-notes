## One-time Pads
This method of encryption provides perfect secrecy provided that the following are met:

* The key should never be reused.
* The key needs to be at least as long as the message:
	* If a longer key is used then the message should be padded.
* You have a perfect source of randomness to generate the keys.
	
Encryption and decryption is completed by:

* XORing the key with the message.

It is ideal in a scenario where you have:

* A slow secure channel to transfer keys in advance.
* A fast insecure channel where you can send your encrypted messages.

This method is too inconvenient to use in e-commerce.

## RSA
RSA relies on the following functions:

* Public key generation function `keygen`: $K \rightarrow L$
* Encryption function `enc`: $X\times L\rightarrow Y$
* Decryption function `dec`: $Y\times K\rightarrow X$

It also requires that the following are true:

* **Correctness** - `dec(end(x, keygen(k)), k)=x` for every $x\in X$ and $k\in K$.
* **Efficiency** - Given $k$ and $x$, it is feasible to compute `keygen(k)`, `enc(x, keygen(k))` and `dec(enc(x, keygen(k)), k)`.
* **Key Secrecy** - Given `l = keygen(k)` and multiple encoded messages using that public key, it is not feasible to compute any of the messages.

## Groups
In algebra a group is a pair $(G, \cdot)$ where $G$ is a set and $\cdot:G\times G\rightarrow G$ is an operator with the following properties:

Identity
: There is an identity element $\mathbf 1\in G$ such that $\mathbf1\cdot x=x\cdot\mathbf1=x$ for every $x\in G$.

Inverse
: For every $x\in G$ there is a $x^{-1}\in G$ such that $x\cdot x:^{-1}=x^{-1}\cdot x=\mathbf 1$.

Associative
: $(x\cdot y)\cdot z=x\cdot(y\cdot z)$ for every $x,y,z\in G$.

Additionally, a group is **finite** if the set $G$ is finite.

### Example Finite Group
Consider the following finite group that is used in RSA:

$$
((\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^*,\times)
$$

This is the group of integers modulo $n$ (except those $x$ where $\text{gcd}(n,x)>1$).

The identity and associative properties for this group are equal to multiplication, however the inverse is calculated differently:

Take any $x\in(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^*$, we will show that $x$ has an inverse:

1. We want to show that there is some $z\in (\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^*$ such that $xz=1$.

	$z$ is the inverse.
	{:.info}
1. We can test the inverse if the following holds:
	
	$$
	xz=1\mod n
	$$
	
	Computing $x^{-1}\mod n$ take logarithmic time with respect to $x$ and $n$. This makes it quite feasible for large numbers on modern hardware.

### Order
Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a finite group, and $x\in G$. The order of $x$, denoted by $\text{ord}(x)$, is the lowest number $i$ such that $x^i=\mathbf 1$.

This power is at most $m$ where $m=\left\vert G\right\vert$.

### Lagrange's Theorem
Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a finite group. Take any $x\in G$ and let $m=\mid G\mid$. Then $\text{ord}(x)$ divides $\mid G\mid$.#

This is to prove that:

If we know $\mid G\mid$, we can easily compute $k=e^{-1}$ and therefore $e\times k=1\mod\mid G\mid$.
	
Therefore $(x^e)^k=x^{e\times k}=x$.
{:.info}

However, for this to be the case we need to know $\mid G\mid$ (we can use this as a key to encrypt $x$). 

### RSA Group Size
The group used in RSA, $(\mathbb Z /n\mathbb Z)^*$, where $n$ is the product of two large primes $p,q$. To calculate the group size:

1. There are $n$ numbers in the group $(\mathbb Z /n\mathbb Z)^*$
1. We must exclude every number $x$ such that k$\text{gcd}(x,n)\neq 1$.
1. ...
1. In total there are $p\times q-p+1$ elements, which is equal to $(p-1)(q-1)$.

### RSA Description
Key Generation:

1. Find two large prime numbers $p$ and $q$.
1. Compute $n=pq$ and $m=(p-1)(q-1)$.
1. Find $e$ such that $gcd(e,m)=1$ and take $k=e^{-1}\mod m$.
1. The public keys are $n$ and $e$. The private key is $k$.

Encryption:

1. For plaintext $x$ compute the ciphertext $y=x^e\mod n$.
1. A large message $x$ may need to be split into several smaller messages.

Decryption:

1. For cipher text $y$, compute the plaintext $y^k\mod n$.

## Public Key Encryption Issues

* You must gain a third party's key in order to send a message to them.
	* You must also trust that the key is their's and not an attacker's.
* Public key cryptography is slower than symmetric key.
* Very large keys are required for good security (4096 bit).

## Public Key Encryption Strengths

* With large keys, RSA is pretty much invulnerable to brute force, known plaintext and chosen plaintext attacks.
* Similar plaintexts product very different cyphertexts.
* Public key distributions is much easier as it can be asynchronous.
