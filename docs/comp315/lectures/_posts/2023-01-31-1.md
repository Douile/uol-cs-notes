## Value Proposition

What do you deliver that is *perceived* to be of value to your customers?

You may choose something that provides no value in order to scam people.
{:.warning}

Revenue Model
: Who will pay you?

Market Situation
: Who are your competitors? What advantage to you have over them? How big is the market for your product? How will you attract your audience?

Organisation
: Who will work for your company and how will they be organised?

There are two considerations to be aware in an e-commerce value proposition:

* Does your value lie in the service you offer, or in how you offer it?
* What does being e-commerce add?

### Revenue Model
There are several types of revenue model:

| Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Sales Model | You get money for selling stuff. |
| Transaction Fee Model | You get paid for selling other people's stuff. |
| Subscription Model | Customers pay a fixed fee for your service. |
| Freemium Model | Basic service is provided for free. Higher tiers use other service models. |
| Advertising Model | Sell advertisements that are shown to your customers. |
| Data Broker Model | You sell access to information about your customers - dangerous. |
| Affiliate Model | You get paid for sending customers to someone else. |
| Donation Model | Get paid by voluntary donations from customers - risky. |

Some services use a combination, or other, models such as:

* The Guardian:
	* Uses advertising and donation online.
	* Uses a subscription model for print.
	
### Market Situation
* How big is the market you are trying to capture?
* What competition do you have?

	Includes both direct competition for the same service, and indirect for substitutes. Uber has direct competition from Lyft, indirect from black cabs and public transport.
	{:.info}
* What advantages/disadvantages do you have compared to the competition?
* Will you have issues with regulation?

### Organisation

* What is your company attitude?
* What is your approach to recruitment?

## Strategy, Operations & Tactics

These are in the following hierarchy:

* Strategy
	* Operations
		* Tactics

They apply to the following analogy:

Strategy <--> bm[Business Model]
Operations <--> td[Technology Decisions]
Tactics <--> Programming
```

This is to say that technology and programming both serve the business model.
