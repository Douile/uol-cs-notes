## Sealed Bid Auction Strategy
You should bid:

* Slightly more than what you expect the highest other bid to be.
* $v$ - your value of the item.
	
	In this case you will make zero profit.
	{:.warning}

You can also play mind games to make your opponents think you have a lower value of the item. This way they will bid lower in response.

* Every bid below $v$ is rationalisable.

### Second Bid Sealed Auction Strategy
You should:

* Bid your valuation $v$.

In this case you will pay the next valuation lower ($t$) than $v$ and you will make at least zero profit.
