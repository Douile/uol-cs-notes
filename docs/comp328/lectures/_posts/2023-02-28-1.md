## Types of Locks

Deadlock
: Occurs when two or more task wait for each other an each will not resume until some action is taken

Livelock
: Occurs when the tasks involved in a deadlock take action to resolve the original deadlock but in such a way that there is no progress.

## Parallel Programming Models
Shared Memory:

* All memory is accessible 
* Programmed using OpenMP.

Distributed Memory:

* Sharing of memory must be explicit.
* Network latency and bandwidth become important.
* Programmed using MPI:
	* Message passing interface.

## Flynn's Taxonomy

MPMD
: Multiple programs multiple data.

SPMD
: Single program multiple data. Can also be multiple copies of the same program.
	
	Data must be passed explicitly between the processes.

## MPI Vocabulary

Process
: Each instance of the code runs as an MPI process. Each process has a numbered *rank*.

Communicator
: A collection of processors that can send messages to each other. The default communicator, containing all processes is `MPI_COMM_WORLD`.

Rank
: A numerical ID of a process within a communicator (indexed from 0).

## Example MPI Programmes

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h>
int main(void){
	MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);
	mpiRankWorkToDo();
	MPI_Finalize();
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h>
int main(void) {
	int myID;
	MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);
	MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &myID);
	printf(“Hi from process ranked %d\n”, myID);
	MPI_Finalize();
}
```

We can compile this with `mpicc` and run it with:

```
$ mpirun –np<num_process> ./a.out
```

## MPI Point-to-Point Communications

* One sender
* One receiver

There are two important functions for MPI (taken from `man`):

```
SYNTAX
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Send(const void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest,
            int tag, MPI_Comm comm)
```

```
SYNTAX
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Recv(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,
            int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)

```

These functions also take the types and source rank to give some static checking.

We need to build in logic so that our code can **detect it's own rank**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <mpi.h>
const int MAX_STRING = 100;
int main(void) {
	int commSize;
	int myRank;
	
	char greeting[MAX_STRING];
	
	MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);
	MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &commSize);
	MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &myRank);
	
	char processor_name[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];
	int name_len;
	MPI_Get_processor_name(processor_name, &name_len);
	
	if(myRank != 0){
		sprintf(greeting, "Greetings from processor %s, process %d of %d!", processor_name, myRank, commSize);
		MPI_Send(greeting, strlen(greeting)+1, MPI_CHAR, 0, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
	} else {
		printf("Greetings from processor %s, process %d of %d!", processor_name, myRank, commSize);
		int i;
		for(i = 1; i < commSize; i++){
			MPI_Recv(greeting, MAX_STRING, MPI_CHAR, i, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
			printf("%s\n", greeting);
		}
	}
}
```

### Point-to-Point Problems
Both `MPI_Recv` and `MPI_Send` are blocking functions:

* Send will not return until it has been received.
* Receive will not return until there is a message.

This can lead to **deadlocks** if all ranks are trying to send an receive at the same time.
{:.warning}

One solution is to have odds send and evens receive for one cycle and then swap if required. This way data will flow properly and there will be no locks.
