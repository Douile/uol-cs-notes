## Performance Lists
You can measure super computers by different metrics:

* Top500 (By linpack, $R_\max$)
* Green500 (Flops/Watt)
* Graph500 (Graph computing)
* HPL-AI (AI computing)

## Using a HPC Cluster

1. Login to login node (don't do any hard work here).
1. Submit work to the compute nodes.

## Measuring Runtime

1. Use one of the functions to get the current time in millis.
1. Check the time again at the end of execution.
	
	Ensure you have **exclusive access** over the compute node you are running on.

1. Run Multiple times (3-5) to ramp up clocks and average out interference from other programs.
1. Report the **minimum** time of all the runs.

As the error $\epsilon$ will always be positive, reporting the minimum time will give the closes to the true value:

$$
r_0=r_t+\epsilon
$$

where:

* $r_0$ - Observed runtime
* $r_t$ - True runtime

## Arithmetic Intensity
Arithmetic intensity is related to the **time complexity** of computations in an algorithm. It can also be characterised by the following equation:

$$
I(n)=\frac{W(n)}{Q(n)}
$$

where $W$ is the number of flops carried out by the program and $Q$ is the number of bytes transferred from memory to cache.

For example if our CPU has 416 Gflop/s and 68 GB/s of compute and memory bandwidth, 6 operations per byte would be ideal. In this case we would be making best use of the hardware.

* Programs with high AI are called **compute-bound** programs.
* Programs with low AI are called **memory-bound** programs.

Generally, modern programs are memory bound.

### Roofline Model

We can measure algorithm performance by comparing to the maximum performance of the system. 

* The peak performance bound is the flop/s of a system.
