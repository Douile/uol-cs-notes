## Barrier (Synchronisation)
We may use syncrnonisation for the following reasons:

* Debugging:
	* We can test communication speed (not load imbalance) by using a barrier before a gather.
* Ensure various task have been completed before continuing:
	* We could also test for completion in a loop while running other non-dependant tasks.
* Reducing side-effects for time sensitive code.
* Enforce ordering.

## Barrier Syntax

```man
C Syntax
       #include <mpi.h>
       int MPI_Barrier(MPI_Comm comm)
```

We should be careful when using barrier as it can significantly slow down code.
