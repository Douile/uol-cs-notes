## Terminology

Parallelism
: Many queues using many resources.

Concurrency
: Many queues sharing one resource.

Processor
: One of: CPU, GPU, ASIC etc.

Core
: A single processor on a CPU

CPU
: One or more cores on a package.

Thread
: In software, a single flow of control in a program.

Die
: A silicon wafer including the CPU and supporting components.

Socket
: The whole CPU package and pins that is inserted into a motherboard.

Node
: A single motherboard.

Cluster/Supercomputer
: 100+ nodes connected through a high-speed interconnect.

## Reasons for Sub-optimal Performance

* CPU
	* Specialised CPU instructions are not utilised.
* Memory Hierarchy
	* Code not exploiting spatio-temporal locality.
	* NUMA effects.
* Work
	* Load imbalance between threads/processes.
	* Too much communication creating a network bottleneck.
	* Resource contention.
* Parallel
	* Overheads of parallel implementation
	* Synchronisation/communication between threads.
	* Threads being scheduled on and off too quickly.
	
## Characterising Computer Performance
We can approximate FP32 flops using the following calculation:

$$
R_\text{peak}=2\times w_\text{vex}\times r_\text{clock}\times n_\text{core} \times n_\text{sock}\times n_\text{node}
$$

The initial times 2 is due to combined add and multiply.

Where:

* $w_\text{vex}$ - Vector width (AVX512 has 16 FP32 flops/s)
* $r_\text{clock}$ - Clock speed
* $n_\text{core}$ - Cores per socket
* $n_\text{sock}$ - Sockets per node
* $n_\text{node}$ - Nodes
