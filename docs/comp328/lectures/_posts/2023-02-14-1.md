## Optimisation Types
There are several operations that can increase the execution speed of the same code:

* Instruction ordering
* Memory access order
* Inlining
	* Functions are included to where they are called from.
* Dead code/stores
	* Code and variables that are never reached, or never have their values read, are removed.
* Code Hoisting
	* Code not required in a loop is moved out of the loop.
* Common sub-expression elimination
* Loop unrolling
* Vectorisation

## Optimisation Reports
When using the Intel compiler `icc` we can monitor what `-On` has done by using:

```
-qopt-reportN
```

where $N=1,2,3,\ldots$.

## Manual Optimisations
Don't:

* Optimise what the compiler has already done.
* Focus on small improvements.

### Profiling
Use profiling (`gprof`) to find where the majority of time is spent in your code. You can then take the following steps:

* Identify memory bottlenecks.
* Register bottlenecks.
* Cache Utilisation.

Then stop when:

* Maximum performance is reached.
* You run out of time or give up.

You can look for the following activities:

* Remove I/O, including prints.
* Remove debug code.
* Remove dead code.
* Check order of memory access (row major).

You can also give the compiler hits (`*restrict`).
